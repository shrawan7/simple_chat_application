Hey! Here is my first application using node.js (express) and socket.io. It is a simple **chat app**. 

# Run App

2) Go to project folder and Install Dependencies using command ```npm install```
3) Now run command ```npm start``` to run the application and if app has started then you can browse it at https://localhost:3000
